# number-guesser

My very first program, written in C# in Visual Studio. Requires .NET.

A simple number guessing game. Pick a difficulty and you'll be asked to guess any number from 1 to 100 (or 1000 if you choose hard mode). Guess it wrong and it'll tell you if you were too high or too low. Once you successfully guess it, it'll tell you how many attempts it took to get the right number.

You're free to re-use this as you'd like, but if you do, please credit me accordingly.
